1. Project Demonstration 
Page 1 
Overview: 
The Smart Building Management System will be demonstrated to stakeholders, 
highlighting its ability to monitor, manage, and optimize building operations through 
real-time data and IoT device integration. The system focuses on automation, energy 
efficiency, safety, and centralized control. 
Demonstration Details: 
• System Walkthrough: A live walkthrough of the smart building platform, 
demonstrating user interface interactions and automated responses to changes 
in environmental parameters. 
• Automation Logic: The system will showcase automation in lighting, HVAC, and 
security systems based on IoT sensor data. 
• IoT Integration: Real-time data such as temperature, humidity, air quality, 
occupancy, and energy consumption from sensors will be displayed and 
analyzed. 
• Performance Metrics: System responsiveness, device communication latency, 
and multi-node scalability under varying loads will be demonstrated. 
• Security & Privacy: Demonstration of access control, data encryption, and 
secure device communication protocols. 
Outcome: 
Stakeholders will see how the system effectively manages building operations using IoT 
data and automation logic, improving energy efficiency, safety, and user comfort.
